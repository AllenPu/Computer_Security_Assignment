# Computer_Security_Assignment
I used C++ to do this assignment
As you can see , the very first step is the main.cpp which implemented the requirement of the Assignment to check if the Pe-1.txt included,if not, write in and create the file, etc.

The file follows the rule:
  main.cpp ->compile to .o file -> than link to .exe file

Script and files  
The simple C++ script is to overwrite the txt content

For Q1 STEP2 : 
![]()
